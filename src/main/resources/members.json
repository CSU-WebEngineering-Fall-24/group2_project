I have been a software engineer for a little over 5 years, and during that time I worked on full-stack engineering, mostly within the Microsoft tech stack (C#/ASP.NET, etc.) working on SaaS (Software as a Service) products. Over the past couple of years, I have found myself gravitating towards front-end engineering, and created a new product for my company that is a WYSIWYG editor for our proprietary outbound member communications (PDFs), working closely with HTML structures and Handlebars rendering engine for dynamic content. My current role is overseeing a team of engineers on our Platform team, positioning myself away from SaaS and full-time coding a bit.",

I work on the Media Services team; which is responsible for moving RTP data and audio through our system.  The work on this team is very interesting as most of the processing as close to real time as possible.  The data that can be handled in a less time restricted manner is one of the projects I am working on.  Essentially, anything that is not time sensitive is being moved to another process without adding any additional delays.  This has been quite challenging and I have had a chance to learn quite a bit.",
