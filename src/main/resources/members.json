I work on the Media Services team; which is responsible for moving RTP data and audio through our system.  The work on this team is very interesting as most of the processing as close to real time as possible.  The data that can be handled in a less time restricted manner is one of the projects I am working on.  Essentially, anything that is not time sensitive is being moved to another process without adding any additional delays.  This has been quite challenging and I have had a chance to learn quite a bit.",
